        <p>Itâ€™s the year 3098 and the USS Starlink is currently headed towards planet Nebulus 401. The ship contains 10,000 passengers in a medically induced long sleep. There are also 50 crew members aboard the ship led by captain Mark Heisenburg. They are only four years into a ten year trip, but everything has gone according to plan so far.</p>

        <p>But in the induced sleeping chambers, there is a short circuit to one of the sleeping pods causing a passenger to wake up 6 years before they are meant to. The passenger has complete amnesia due to the malfunction of the pod, unable to remember their own name or even what they look like they are in a complete panicked state. Observing the surroundings, they see thousands of others in the pods asleep and tranquil. They walk up to the only other mysteriosly empty pod to find that the glass cover has been smashed and is coated in blood. In the reflection of one of the pieces of broken glass, our protaganist sees she is a woman with dark hair and dark eyes, however she is unable to recognize herself and feels strange as if she doesn't belong in this body. </p>

        <p>Intrigued by the bloody scene in front of her and still in a daze from exiting deep sleep, the protagonist decided to explore the corridors further for answers.
           Bit by bit she inspected the blinding white halls of the ship, spotting rogue specks of blood as she ambled along. The blood appeared fresh, but from what she could tell the source was not nearby, nor did it create a trail leading anywhere.
           Her mindless journey came to an abrupt stop when she spotted a figure peering at her from the other end of the hallway.</p>

        <p>Several hours later, the second-in-command, Brian Mortes, approached the captain with a distressed expression.
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;"Captain Heisenburg, there seems to be an issue wi-"
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;"MORTES!" the captain snapped, not wanting to draw his attention away from his word search, "Can't you see I'm busy?!"
        <br>
        Captain Heisenburg's eyes ravaged the puzzle, a list of crossed-out words sat at the bottom of the page. He seemed to be stuck on finding "hedgehog." Mortes groaned in frustration, "hedgehog" was in the last column on the left-hand side. Desperate for his superior's attention, Mortes reached over the captain's shoulder and pointed to the word.
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;"There," he grumbled. The captain's face lit up.
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;"Mortes, my boy! This is why we keep you around!" Heisenburg beamed, "Now, what did you need?"
        <br>Exasperated, Mortes explained, "It's one of the passengers. Somehow they managed to wake themselves up from the medically induced sleep cycle!"
        <br>The captain's expression faltered as he soon realized the implications of the matter. If one person could wake up, so could the others. The ship was only equipped with enough food and supplies for the crew. If more passengers awoke, they'd be overwhelmed and scrambling for resources in an instant.

        <p>Captain Heisenberg sent Mortes to figure out how the passenger woke up from the medically induced sleep. Then, Heisenberg sent himself on the mission to find the missing passenger. He checked the halls and corridors one by one, making sure to inform any crewmate he came across to keep a lookout for the passenger. After five hours of looking the passenger was no where to be seen. This meant that they must be purposely hiding. However, this wasn't the only problem. While the captain was searching the ship, he found out that one of the crew members had also gone missing.</p>

           <p>"Disgusting," the captain mumbled as he stuck his finger into a sticky green ooze inside the smashed empty pod, there was drops of blood from the glass leading up into the vents of the ship, the captain followed the trail nervous as he had a very bad feeling about this.Meanwhile, our unidentified female passenger had heard the captain coming down the hall and in her confused began running
              through the ship with no real destination or direction in mind. She ended up stumbling upon Mortes who was busy in the medical control room trying to find the error in the medical sleep induction pods. Both jumped back in fear and surprise to seeing one another and the passenger took off again blindly, running into a protruding piece of sharp metal and falling to the ground with a scream cradling a now open wound.
              <br>
              &emsp;&emsp;"WAIT! I am here to help you" Mortes yelled, approaching the now passenger slowly with a box of emergency medical equipment found on the wall.
              <br>She eyed him suspicously but gladly took the medical guaze from his outstretched hand. Mortes backed away carefully as to not alarm the woman and waited for the next move.

        <p>Having patched up her wounds, the rogue passenger approached Mortes and explained her predicament.
          <br>
          &emsp;&emsp;"Do you have any memory of your identity?" Mortes asked. The passenger's expression contorted into one of exhausted confusion.
          <br>
          &emsp;&emsp;"All I know is that this body isn't mine. I think I used to be an engineer of some sort, but that's about as far as it goes." she replied.
          <br>
          A chill went down Mortes' spine; was this passenger actually the missing crewmate the captain mentioned? No, no, that's impossible, right? Anxious to calm his fears, Mortes decided to pry further.
          <br>&emsp;&emsp;"Please don't take this the wrong way," Mortes said as he began to roll up his sleeve, "but does this look at all familiar?" Upon the inside of his forearm read "USS-SL-A10." When agreeing to the mission, all crewmates were required to have an identification tag marked on their person in case of separation or emergency.
          <br>The passenger studied the tag intently.
          <br>&emsp;&emsp;"USS Starline Crew Group A10...? That was my team!" she exclaimed, finally making some progress in remembering her identity.

        <p>The revelation didn't last long however, as the protagonist clutched suddenly at her head, a blinding pain racking her entire body.
          Her freshly dressed wounds reopened, soaking through the guaze at an alarming rate. Mortes looked on in frozen horror as
          not only did dark red blood seep through, but the same strange green substance he noticed before also dripped onto the ground.
          <br>
          &emsp;&emsp;"Please," she croaked out, "I don't know what's wrong-"
          <br>
          Her sentence was cut short as the protagonist crumpled to the floor, sickly green spreading across her skin
          from the festering wound. Her screams echoed throughout the space station, loud enough to alert the only other waking crew member.
          <br>
          But no matter how fast Captain Heisenberg traversed the maze of hallways, it was too late. The transformation had only
          just begun...
