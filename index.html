      <p>It’s the year 3098 and the USS Starlink is currently headed towards planet Nebulus 401. The ship contains 10,000 passengers is a medically induced long sleep. There are also 50 crew members aboard the ship led by captain Mark Heisenburg. They are only four years into a ten year trip, but everything has gone according to plan so far.</p>

      <p>But in the induced sleeping chambers, there is a short circuit to one of the sleeping pods causing a passenger to wake up 6 years before they are meant to. The passenger has complete amnesia due to the malfunction of the pod, unable to remember their own name or even what they look like they are in a complete panicked state. Observing the surroundings, they see thousands of others in the pods asleep and tranquil. They walk up to the only other mysteriously empty pod to find that the glass cover has been smashed and is coated in blood. In the reflection of one of the pieces of broken glass, our protaganist sees she is a woman with dark hair and dark eyes, however she is unable to recognize herself and feels strange as if she doesnt belong in this body. </p>

      <p>Several hours later, the second-in-command, Brian Mortes, approached the captain with a distressed expression.
      <br>
      &emsp;&emsp;"Captain Heisenburg, there seems to be an issue wi-"
      <br>
      &emsp;&emsp;"MORTES!" the captain snapped, not wanting to draw his attention away from his word search, "Can't you see I'm busy?!"
      <br>
      Captain Heisenburg's eyes ravaged the puzzle, a list of crossed-out words sat at the bottom of the page. He seemed to be stuck on finding "hedgehog." Mortes groaned in frustration, "hedgehog" was in the last column on the left-hand side. Desperate for his superior's attention, Mortes reached over the captain's shoulder and pointed to the word.
      <br>
      &emsp;&emsp;"There," he grumbled. The captain's face lit up.
      <br>
      &emsp;&emsp;"Mortes, my boy! This is why we keep you around!" Heisenburg beamed, "Now, what did you need?"
      <br>Exasperated, Mortes explained, "It's one of the passengers. Somehow they managed to wake themselves up from the medically induced sleep cycle!"
      <br>The captain's expression faltered as he soon realized the implications of the matter. If one person could wake up, so could the others. The ship was only equipped with enough food and supplies for the crew. If more passengers awoke, they'd be overwhelmed and scrambling for resources in an instant.
